# BD Division Map

It's an HTML code snippet. Here, a complete map of Bangladesh has been created on a division-wise basis using HTML's SVG and CSS. Here every division is clickable, meaning you can link to each division in the form of a button. You can call it a category system where by clicking on each category, you can reach your destination according to your link.
